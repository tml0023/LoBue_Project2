Troy LoBue's corrections for Capstone Project 2

1. "Error when no file and aborts 0/5"

Question#1: (5pts) When the script is executed, it should require a command argument of the input fasta file. 
A sanity check should be performed to ensure the user has included the fasta file on the command line when executing the script. 
If not, it should print an error instructing the user to include the filename when executing the script and abort.

Corrction: The reason my script was not terminating after recognizing the wrong number of arguements
was because I did not have the "exit" command in the loop. Since I changed the condition to != 1 (not equal) 
I can say exit which will terinate the script if the condition is not met which is what we want.


2. "Num sequences variable 0/2"

Question#3: (2 pts) Following these successful sanity checks, setup a command to calculate the number of sequences in the input fasta file.
Then, make a variable to hold this number. Hint: Look back at Lab#1 at an easy way to perform this calculation. 

Correction: My sequence number variable was not working correctly because I was not explicitely removing the header from the sequence. Using the grep and sed combo
replaces the > charcter in the heading and also we move the headers and sequences into isolated files. This allows us to use the temporary files until the end of the 
loop at which point we can remove the temporary files. 

3. "Made empty file (touch) 0/2"

Question#4: The script should use a command to create an empty file called GCcount.txt (2 pts). 
The script should print a header to this output file containing two columns: 1) “Sequence name” and 2) “GC Percentage” (3 pts).

Correction: My script echoed the header to the created GCcount text file. I used touch to create this file and the header was 
created with the echo command. The data was then appended to the table under the header.
